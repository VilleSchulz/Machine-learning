    "**BoardGameGeek** is a comprehensive online database that consists of over 125,600 board games, providing access to reviews, discussion forums, and detailed information on individual titles. It is widely recognized as the most extensive repository of board game data available. In addition to serving as an information resource, the platform enables users to rate games on a 1–10 scale and to manage their personal game collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a recommender system that leverages data from BoardGameGeek to suggest board games to users. We chose a matrix factorization collaborative filtering approach, using community rating data to learn latent features of users and games. The system generates personalized recommendations for a selected user, based on their past ratings."
