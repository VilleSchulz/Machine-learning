    "**BoardGameGeek** is a comprehensive online database that consists of over 125,600 board games, providing access to reviews, discussion forums, and detailed information on individual titles. It is widely recognized as the most extensive repository of board game data available. In addition to serving as an information resource, the platform enables users to rate games on a 1–10 scale and to manage their personal game collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a recommender system that leverages data from BoardGameGeek to suggest board games to users. We chose an item-based collaborative filtering approach, using community rating data to find similarities between games. The system will generate personalized recommendations for selected user, based on their individual rating history."

    "- **GAMES** – Contains core details for approximately **22,000 board games** with **47 features**.  \n",
    "  Each game is identified by a unique **BGGId**, serving as the primary key. This file includes metadata such as publication year, minimum/maximum players, average playtime, and average user rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RATINGS_DISTRIBUTION** – Provides the **full rating distribution** for each game (`BGGId`), detailing how users rated the game on a 1–10 scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **THEMES** – Lists **thematic categories** associated with each game (`BGGId`), allowing thematic-based filtering and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MECHANICS** – Includes **game mechanics** represented as binary indicators per game, enabling insights into gameplay styles (e.g., deck building, worker placement, area control).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SUBCATEGORIES** – Contains **secondary classifications** (binary flags) that describe additional attributes or gameplay aspects of each title.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ARTISTS_REDUCED** – Identifies **artists** involved in the visual design of each game.  \n",
    "  Only artists with more than 3 works are included explicitly; others are represented by a binary flag.\n",

    "- **DESIGNERS_REDUCED** – Provides information about **game designers**, using the same filtering logic as the artists file (designers with >3 works listed individually).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PUBLISHERS_REDUCED** – Contains **publisher information** with binary flags for those associated with fewer than 3 published games.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **USER_RATINGS** – The largest and most critical table for recommendation modeling.  \n",
    "  It contains user-generated ratings with over **411,000 unique users** and approximately **19 million ratings**, linking users to the games they have rated via `username` and `BGGId`."
