    "\n",
    "Phishing websites are a major cybersecurity threat, aiming to steal sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details. Detecting them early is essential to protect users from financial loss, identity theft, and reputational damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to test whether phishing websites can be reliably identified using simple, automatically collected features such as SSL certificate status, URL patterns, web traffic, and link structure. A successful model could support the development of an automated warning system that alerts users before they enter a phishing site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two approaches will be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Trees** – to create a transparent, human-readable model that can be directly translated into analyst instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forests** – to improve predictive accuracy through an ensemble of decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project seeks to balance **interpretability** (decision tree rules that are understandable to an internet analyst) and **accuracy** (improved prediction via random forests). If successful, the models can form the foundation of a practical phishing detection tool, contributing to safer online interactions for end-users.\n",

If successful, the models can form the foundation of a practical phishing detection tool, contributing to safer online interactions for end-users.\n",

    "We are using the Phishing dataset that is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Phishing Websites Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/327/phishing+websites). The target variable Result indicates whether a website is a phishing site or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: As the interpretation of the -1’s and 1’s in the Result column seems to be missing from the document, it may be helpful to know that a ‘1‘ corresponds to a phishing site and a ‘-1’ to a legitimate site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to find out whether it is possible to reliably predict whether a website is a phishing site or not based on the easily obtainable information about the website. Based on the outcome, it is possible to construct an automated system that warns users when they are about to visit a phishing website.\n"

    "## 2. Data understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is the **[Phishing Websites Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/327/phishing+websites)** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains **11,055 instances** with **30 predictive features**, all integer-valued and with no missing values. The **target variable** `Result` is encoded as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 = phishing site**\n",
    "- **–1 = legitimate site**\n",
    "\n",
    "This label encoding is not clearly stated in the UCI documentation but confirmed in related papers, making it important to highlight here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1. Feature Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The features represent structural and behavioral properties of websites that can be collected automatically. They are designed to capture common tricks used in phishing attacks. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URL and domain structure**:  \n",
    "  - *IP Address*: phishing URLs may use numeric IPs instead of domain names.  \n",
    "  - *URL Length*: overly long URLs can hide malicious elements.  \n",
    "  - *Prefix-Suffix*: hyphens in domains (e.g., `paypal-security.com`) often imitate real sites.  \n",
    "  - *Having Subdomain*: excessive subdomains may disguise a malicious site.  \n",
    "  - *HTTPS-token*: misleading use of “https” inside the domain name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security indicators**:  \n",
    "  - *SSLfinal_State*: validity of the SSL certificate.  \n",
    "  - *Domain Registration Length* and *Age of Domain*: short-lived or newly created domains are more suspicious.  \n",
    "  - *DNS Record*: missing or abnormal DNS entries suggest fraud.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content and linking patterns**:  \n",
    "  - *Request URL* and *URL of Anchor*: percentage of external objects or anchor links leading outside the domain.  \n",
    "  - *Links in Tags*: external links inside `<meta>`, `<script>`, and `<link>` tags.  \n",
    "  - *Favicon*: loading icons from external sources instead of the main site.  \n",
    "  - *Links Pointing to Page*: legitimate sites typically have more inbound links.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **User interaction tricks**:  \n",
    "  - *On-mouseover*: changes in the browser’s status bar on hover.  \n",
    "  - *RightClick* and *PopUpWindow*: disabling user actions or forcing pop-ups.  \n",
    "  - *Iframe*: use of hidden frames to load external content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traffic and reputation**:  \n",
    "  - *Web Traffic*: phishing sites typically have very low visitor numbers.  \n",
    "  - *PageRank*, *Google Index*: trusted sites are usually ranked and indexed.  \n",
    "  - *Statistical Report*: cross-check against known phishing/malware blacklists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2. Class Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is moderately balanced, with around **6,157 legitimate** vs **4,898 phishing** websites. This makes it well-suited for supervised learning methods such as decision trees and random forests without requiring heavy imbalance correction."
